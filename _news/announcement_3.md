Here's my experience of working with a valley based startup Noodle.ai. The way work happens and how much I liked it.

***

Last year, I took up an offer from a startup to work as part of their data science team in building and expanding their infrastructure and client presence.

#### Things I loved
<ul>
    <li>more responsibility and freedom</li>
    <li>small team</li>
    <li>more opportunities to create impact</li>
    <li>friendly work environment</li>
</ul>

Again, I put in a lot of consideration into my decision to venture into a new world. But, that was something I realized I had to do.
