**Number Plate Recognition Android Application**

**ABSTRACT**

Vehicle number plate recognition is one of the
most interesting and challenging research topic from past few
years. It is shown that the number plates are different shape
and size and also have different color in different countries. In
this project we developed an android application for localization
of number plates of the vehicles and segmented the numbers
as to identify each number separately. This paper presents an
approach based on simple and efficient morphological operation
and sobel edge detection method. We also presents a deep
learning based approach to segmented all the letters and
numbers used in the number plate. After reducing noise from
the input image we try to enhance the contrast of the presents
a simple approach to segmented all the letters and numbers
used in the number plate.
